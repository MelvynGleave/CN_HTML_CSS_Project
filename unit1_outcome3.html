        <h3>Question 3.1</h3>
        <h3>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
            productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h3>
        <p>At the start of the project I was quite new to the tools being used, experiance has definitely made a difference to my productivity and efficiency in using these tools.</p>
        <p>Trello's benefits in planning, project monitoring and task definition are great, but there is an overhead involved. For many tasks this overhead is small, just updating the card from one column to another In others it is more involved, when having to comment and provide examples as part of an update for instance. On the whole it's benefits have greatly outweighed the small overhead though.</p>
        <p>All of the main drawbacks I found with Visual Studio Code stemmed from inexperiance with this tool. I feel that experience has eliminated most of them and the benefits in productivity and structure it provides are worth the time spent learning to use it. It will be my tool of choice for personal projects in the future.</p>
        <p>Github's main drawback is that I could become over-reliant on it, keeping my entire project uploaded and therefore losing the ability to work on it if I am without an internet connection. That said, it is a definite aid to any project as it automates a lot of the mundane tasks of code versioning and also provides a measure of security against equipment failure leading to loss of progress.</p>
        <p>The project could definitely have been done in teams, although the results may have been beyond the intended scope of the project. Being able to assign roles to individuals with particular talents such as graphic design, coding and project management would have further increased productivity and efficiency leading to more polished outcomes.</p>

        <h3>Question 3.2</h3>
        <h3>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h3>
      
        <p>Enhancing productivity and efficiency begins with the planning stage. Correctly structuring the project and defining the processes to be followed will allow for the correct choices to be made in management and development tools.</p>
        <p>The tools chosen must address some fundamental needs of collaborative projects. Communication, workflow organisation, time tracking and interoperability. A well chosen set of tools will allow your development team to stay in touch through the project. It will allow them to share ideas, solutions, content and code. It will track what team members are working on and make it simpler to see problems as they develop. And it will provide a working environment that adds useful functionality for the team, while minimising unnecessary distractions and clutter.</p>
        <p>Free coffee and biscuits help too.</p>

        <h3>Question 3.3</h3>
        <h3>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do diferently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>
      
        <p>The main way I would improve the productivity and efficiency of my own development process would be with improved planning. With improved knowledge of the tools due to use I can see that I should have planned for overheads inherent in the use of the tools, and not overthought some of my decisions about project content as these turned out to be addressed by features of the tools I had not fully acknowledged at the start. The use of Slack in the project also declined as time went on, it's functions being taken over by Github, Trello and online documents. Slack was still a great tool for communicating with CodeNation staff and other students, and provided ad-hoc file transfers when needed.</p>
        <p>I could have set up my environment better as well. I later started connecting my laptop to a monitor to increase screen space and this did help a lot in organising my work. I developed a standard set of tabs for use in Chrome to display the various references and tools I was using as I worked, which speeded up both development and testing.</p>
        <p>For a project of this size, the use of teams can be debateable. Having a team would allow dedicated roles to improve efficiency, but there may not be enough actual work involved for some of those roles, or to justify the additional overhead. For a project with increased scope, where the project included more content or involved a greater number of technologies, this option would become more useful.</p>

        <h3>Question 3.4</h3>
        <h3>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h3>
      
        <p>Testing of individual pieces of code should be done when the coder is satisfied they are ready to be added to the project. This makes unit testing part of the development process and can usually be done by the coder themselves. This process just confirms that the code does what it is intended to do without producing errors.</p>
        <p>Once the code is made a part of the project as a whole it should become a part of the project's testing plan. A task can be added to the project's Trello board, for example, so that a tester can test the whole project with the code in place to ensure that it works as a part of the greater whole. Any issues can be added as new ToDo cards for the attention of a developer.</p>
        <p>After the coding tasks are all done, all of the projects parts should now be present for a more intensive testing regime. This should be done as though the project was actually in use, possibly by actual customers. Once again, issues can be added to the project board for the attention of developers.</p>
        <p>In the case of a website or similar, that may be used on different platforms, it is important to integrate cross-platform testing into the process as soon as possible to identify possible platform dependent issues that can be communicated to the whole development team. This will avoid the same issues occurring multiple times and requiring more testing and resolution time.</p>
        <p>It is important to exercise version control during this process. Once developers start working on the issues produced by testing, there may be multiple versions of a single piece of code or content in use.</p>
