        <h3>Question 2.1</h3>
        <h3> Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
            your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h3>
        <p>Looking back at the tools used for this project I am largely happy with the choices made, most of the issues I have experienced have been down to unfamiliarity with the tools and have rectified themselves through experience.</p>
        <p>Trello has been a great help in breaking down the project into individual goals and organising the project's tasks. Once I was used to it I also found it useful in preventing myself from taking on too much at one time. With more practice I'm sure it will become even more helpful.</p>
        <p>Visual Studio Code has been an excellent development environment, both easy to use and packed with useful features. The continual syntax checking and predictive text have been worth getting used to the learning process involved on their own.</p>
        <p>Github was a later addition to the project, but has also preved to be valuable. Acting as a repository for the project files that I can access from anywhere with an internet connection, it will make future projects even easier to manage. It's built in file comparison and versioning makes keeping the project files up to date easy. Lastly, it's ability to publish the web site directly from a repository is an excellent way to check a live version of the site and has helped a lot in testing.</p>

        <h3>Question 2.2</h3>
        <h3>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h3>      
        <p>The selection of tools for the project has proved to be very good. Trello has worked very well and is getting more useful the more I use it, without being over-complicated. Visual Studio Code has made the writing of the project's HTML and CSS much simpler, and effectively prevents most simple errors from getting to the testing stage. Github is now a firm favorite of mine, replacing folder-based code management and manual uploading of content to the site itself.</p>
        <p>For a project of this size, these tools have all proved to be capable of the tasks required without adding extra features or requirements that might have been too much for a small project carried out by a single developer.</p>

        <h3>Question 2.3</h3>
        <h3>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>
      
        <p>In general I feel that the project has gone well. The main strengths of the finished website are simplicity and functionality. I planned from the start to stick strictly to HTML and CSS, with no external content, to make the website as lean and simple as I could. If there is anything I want to change it is the small number of images and visual aids used. Going forward I would be looking to add more content and images to improve the presentation of the site, while still keeping the simple theme.</p>

        <h3>Question 2.4</h3>
        <h3>Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h3>
      
        <p>With a little more research I would expand some of the answers given a little, to better cover the available information, and add relevant images and visual aids for some of the points made, this may need moving the project to a page-per-subject structure with expanded navigation menus.</p>
        <p>I would also like to to do a site review, and some more research, on enhancing accessibility on the website. I feel this is an important omission in the project so far.</p>
        <p>On a coding front I am considering improving the navigation bars with either a series of drop-down menus at the top of the page, or a slide-out menu at the left to save screen space.</p>

        <h3>Question 2.5</h3>
        <h3>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h3>
      
        <p>Looking at the outcome of the project I believe it matches the original requirements quite closely. As both a product itself and a description of how that product was created it serves it's function well.</p>
        <p>I started the project by planning the layout and structure around the desired content. The content itself was researched and references were included to external content used in the research. I created a consistant format for the content using CSS and creating each page from a common HTML content based on the landing page, this keeps the look and feel of the site consistant and aids clarity. I used a combination of Trello, Github and Visual Studio Code to organise the project and it's files and finally tested the website after each version was committed to Github to ensure that it functioned correctly.</p>
