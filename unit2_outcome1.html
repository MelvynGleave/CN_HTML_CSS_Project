        <h3>Question 1.1</h3>
        <h3>Describe the content and layout of each page of the website.</h3>
        <p>The website consists of six pages. A landing page that includes my 'about me' section and a footer containing contact information, a page for each of the unit outcome sections that will show the questions and answers for each, and a reference list.</p>
        <p>All pages will feature a navigation menu at the left-hand side. On the landing page this will contain a link to each other page. On the outcome pages this will contain internal anchor links to each question section on that page, along with a link back to the landing page. On the reference list there will be just a link to the landing page.</p>

        <h3>Question 1.5</h3>
        <h3>Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h3>
      
        <p>Copyright laws protect creative works from unauthorized use, giving content creators a legal framework to prevent others from using the creator's work for their own gain. As Rich Stim says in his article <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/website-permissions/websites/">"Websites: Five ways to stay out of trouble"</a> It's a good idea to assume that all works are protected, especially online.</p> Copyright infringement can lead to hefty fines and damages under both UK and US law.</p>
        <p>It's also important to keep other potential issues in mind. If you are designing logo's or graphics for a project, trademark infringement could be a problem. If collecting personal data from visitors or customers it would be a good idea to check local data protection regulations, such as the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> if operating in the European Union.</p>

        <h3>Question 1.6</h3>
        <h3> Describing access issues that need taking into account, describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h3>
      
        <p>There can be a lot of challenges facing people with disabilities when it comes to using digital content. Visually impaired people will not see images, text fomatting, tooltips or controls such as buttons. Hearing impaired people will not hear music or sound cues, and may have problems with customer service systems that rely on voice chat. Physically impaired people may have trouble with standard input devices and need to use alternatives that make navigating apps or websites difficult.</p>
        <p>The World Wide Web Consortium have published <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">guidelines</a> aimed at content creators, to promote practices that aid accessibility. These can range from simple measures like providing alternative text for images or transcripts and subtitles for audio, to a range of measures to ensure that all content is keyboard friendly to allow the use of assistive technologies.</p>

        <h3>Question 1.7</h3>
        <h3>Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h3>
      
        <p>There are a relatively large number of file types associated with websites. For markup and code the basic types are .HTML, .CSS, .JS, .PHP, ASPX. Image types are usually compressed files, to minimise file size, and are commonly .JPG, .GIF, .SVG or .PNG. Uncompressed image types like .BMP are best avoided except as downloadable content.</p>
