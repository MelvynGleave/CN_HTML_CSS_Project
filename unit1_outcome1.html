        <h3>Question 1.1</h3>
        <h3>Describe the purpose of IT in a modern business.</h3>
        <p>Modern businesses have to handle large amounts of data of a great variety of types. It is IT that makes this possible. IT provides the frameworks that efficient and safe handling of this data are built around. It provides the tools that make this data available to the people that need it, and prevent access to those who don't.</p>
        <p>IT drives innovation in business. Providing them with better, faster and more accurate ways to gather potential customer data, identify trends in the market and plan for succesful campaigns to address those trends. It allows for better planning of manufacturing, logistics and customer support through more accurate reporting and improved methods of monitoring and improving product flow. IT provides the basis for better employee experience as well. Facilitating more flexible working without compromising productivity through innovations in remote working and workload balancing.</p>
        <p>So, well designed IT systems will improve productivity, employee engagement and provide a better customer experience. In the future IT will continue to push businesses forward. More intelligent systems will provide better strategic planning and more accurate targeting of campaigns. The continual advance of digital media into all parts of our lives will make fast assessment, planning and response a must for a succesful business. In the past IT revolved around the business, in the future business will more and more revolve around IT.</p>

        <h3>Question 1.2</h3>
        <h3>Describe the methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h3>
      
        <p>Delivering a succesful digital project will require methods to manage the project, it's resources and personnel. In the past many projcts had a monolithic development process with distinct phases, such as the Waterfall methodology. More recent projects feature a lighter weight and more agile method. In an article on the Forecast blog site <a href="https://blog.forecast.it/5-steps-to-managing-a-digital-project"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Kasper Nymand states that, regardless of the method eventually decided upon, a digital project can be broken down into five steps. Scoping, Planning, Development, Testing and Deployment, and Maintenance. This seems to be broadly true from most examples viewed.</p>
        <p>Scoping is the process of defining the requirements of the project along with it's limits. Planning includes the breakdown of the project into smaller, distinct tasks and allows for the necessary resources to be defined. Development is the process of fulfilling those tasks. Testing and delivery include reviewing the end product as a whole to ensure quality before deployment. Maintenence, often overlooked in early development projects, includes provision for ongoing support for the product, including bug fixing and necessary upgrades.</p>

        <h3>Question 1.3</h3>
        <h3>Plan and carry out tasks using IT. e.g. making your website.</h3>
      
        <p>	In the case of this website the scope is quite small. The requirement is for a website that will display the data for the project itself, along with some information about myself. I have chosen a lightweight, Kanban-style management system using a Trello board to show progress of the various content creation and development tasks undertaken. I have also decided to design the landing page and a page for the content first, and use these as a template for the layout of other pages. I'll do my research on the content and write drafts of the content in a text document, expecting these to affect decisions about the resources needed. I also started looking at Git/Github as a potential version management system.</p>
        <p>Looking forward to the development stage we have a sound foundation already in place. The standard for web development starts with HTML, and CSS will provide a centralised format for the site. I will use online resources such as w3school.com for reference and develop the pages and CSS file in Visual Studio Code.</p>

        <h3>Question 1.4</h3>
        <h3>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
      
        <p>	The Project Management Institute defines risk as “An uncertain event or condition that has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.”</p>
	    <p>Risk assessment for a development project offers a number of challenges. Risks can come in many forms, from equipment failures, software incompatibilities, staff absence, changing market factors or almost anything that you can think of.</p>
        <p>That's an important point. Because anything you can think of can be planned for.</p>
        <p>Karen Torok, in her article "What is risk in a digital project and why should I care" <a href="https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, states that "the biggest risk is failing to plan". This makes a lot of sense, as most risks can be mitigated by carefully planning and creating contingencies. She goes on to break down risks into categories of Known and Unknown, Understood and Not Understood. Known and understood risks are the easiest to cope with, as they should be a part of the project plan to start with, Known but not understood risks can be more challenging, requiring a 'plan B' approach as we can plan for the occurence, but not fully plan for the results. The real problems start with the Unknown risks, as we naturally cannot plan fully for these. This puts part of our planning priority on identifying as many of these risks as possible, and planning contingencies for the unknowns in the form of alternative solutions and spare resources or time.</p>

        <h3>Question 1.5</h3>
        <h3>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.
            How do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
      
        <p>Choosing the tools for a project will depend heavily on the scope and goals of a project. Large customer-facing digital projects need to consider carefully the full development process, including deployment and maintenance phases, before choosing their tools and platform in order to ensure the maximum availability and usability of the final product. It is important however to consider whether a tool is overkill for the job, incurring unnecessary costs and complicating the project without providing an advantage. Another consideration is the existing IT infrastructure and resources of the company or client.</p>
        <p>Some choices are easier than others. For example, for developing a simple website like this one there are some standards that define the basic environment we will work in. For a website, HTML is standard for markup, and is both easy to access and has many online sources to help with the site's creation. CCS is a standardised way of providing a consistent look and feel for a website through a set of common formats for content. Both of these solutions taken together provide a solid base for our project and will work with other solutions that may be needed for parts of the project.</p>
        <p>Some choices will require considerably more research and planning. Does our project require a database? Will it need to be available on mobile devices? Will it need to link to other services like social media or cloud storage? Having back-end business logic and a database will considerably to the project's scope and will require additional tools, resources and skills, as well as limiting the platform we can use.</p>
        <p>As a final stage, when the available and relevant platforms, technologies and tools have been shortlisted, it's time to review the dependancies and interoperability of these choices. Some may be great at their job, but may preclude the use of the best solution in another part of the project. As with most projects, compromises will have to be made.</p>

        <h3>Question 1.6</h3>
        <h3>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control?</h3>
      
        <p>For this project I used a Trello board to provide a simple way to manage the flow of my project. This has been a huge help in defining the tasks needed for the project and in monitoring it's progress. Breaking the project down into small, manageable tasks that can be worked on piece by piece prevents the overall project from being an overwhelming mess.</p>
        <p>I used Visual Studio Code as my development tool. It's interface allows easy viewing of all the files associated with the task simultaneously and being able to switch between them quickly was a great help. It also provided syntax checking and predictive text functionality dependant on the file type being viewed, which made writing code a simpler and quicker process.</p>
        <p>Github was used for document management and version control of the project's files. This provided a platform that would allow reversion of files in the case of problems being discovered during testing, as well as an easy repository to aid with the final deployment.</p>

        <h3>Question 1.7</h3>
        <h3>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.
            How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
      
        <p>The subject of legal issues and compliance is a large one, but the main areas to be aware of are copyright and third party content, trademark infringement, digital marketing laws and the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Copyright laws can vary between jurisdictions, but most companies are aware of these already. Trademark law is also well understood. Digital marketing laws govern the ways in which goods or services can be advertised and sold, so can also have an impact on any digital project. The regional variations of these laws and regulations can often require digital projects to develop seperate branches for different jurisdictions, complicating project planning and maintenance.</p>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation is intended to safeguard personal data, defined generally as data that relates to an identifiable individual, and is based on seven principles that are described in the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/">Information Commissioner's Office guide to the GDPR.</a> It covers the collection, processing, storage and dissemination of all personal data related to UK or EU citizens and so is a major consideration for businesses who are investing in digital projects that will involve customer data. The risks of non-compliance with the GDPR can be serious. In cases of failure to comply with administrative requirements a fine of up to 10 million euros, or 2% of global annual turnover, can be levied. In more serious cases this can be as high as 20 million euros. or 4% of global annual turnover.</p>
